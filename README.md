# CarbonTools

CarbonTools is a ruby gem focused on providing an easy way for developers to calculate the environmental (CO2) cost of *X* amount of bytes used within their program.
This is heavily inspired from the npm package [carbon-tools](), although is no longer being maintained and thought this could be useful as a gem rather than an npm package. Both for ease of installation to new projects, and expandability of 'hopefully' included databases.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'carbon_tools'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install carbon_tools

## Usage

### Converter

### CLI
To start the cli simply run: `$ bin/carbon-tools`, and you will be prompted with instructions from their.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
